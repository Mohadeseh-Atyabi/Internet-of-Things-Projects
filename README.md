Make a replacement for a push switch to turn the LED on and off using an LDR. Note that the key must save its previous state. For example, if you put your hand in front of the LDR once and remove it, the LED will turn on and stay on, and when you place your hand near the LDR again, the LED will turn off. (To simulate in Proteus, change the LDR resistance manually.)

# [Smart Umbrella](https://github.com/Mohadeseh-Atyabi/Internet-of-Things-Projects/tree/main/Smart%20Umbrella)
Consider we are supposed to make smart umbrellas for the restaurant tables. When at least one of the following situations occurs, this umbrella opens:  
- The rain is detected by the water sensor.
- Solar radiation is recognized by the LDR resistor.

The umbrella should be closed if none of the aforementioned circumstances apply. The servo motor rotates completely to perform the opening and closing.

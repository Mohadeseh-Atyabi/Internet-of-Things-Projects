Make a replacement for a push switch to turn the LED on and off using an LDR. Note that the key must save its previous state. For example, if you put your hand in front of the LDR once and remove it, the LED will turn on and stay on, and when you place your hand near the LDR again, the LED will turn off. (To simulate in Proteus, change the LDR resistance manually.)
